A specialized set for integers, ideal when:

- The number of elements is known ahead of time (or a good approximation)
- The number of elements doesn't change drastically over time
- The values are naturally random

As long as the number of elements within the set stays close to the originally specified size (I don't know the magic number, so let's say Â±10%), and that they stay evenly distributed. the set will exhibit good read and write performance, as well as decent memory usage. When packed, read performance is roughly 2x better than a map[int]struct{} with memory usage less than 1/2.


```go
set := intset.Sized(1000000)  //or inteet.Sized32(100000)
set.Set(32)
set.Exists(32)
```

## Methods
The `int` and `uint32` variations have the same API (except for the obvious difference that one deals with `int` and the other with `uint32`).

- `Set(int)`
- `Exits(int) bool`
- `Remove(int) bool`
- `Len() int`
- `Each(f func(value int))`

(It's hopefully obviously where a `uint32` is expected when dealing with the `uint32` variant)

## Intersections
Two or more sets can be intersected by calling `Intersect` or `Intersect32`. This is largely a reference implementation and callers should consider implementing their own. For example, maybe you want to stop after finding X matches, want to use a pooled array object to hold intermediary objects, or are fine with getting an array back (rather than a set) (all of which should result in much better performance).

The method is called via:

```go
result := intset.Intersect([]Set{s1, s2})
//or
result := intset.Intersect32([]Set32{s1, s2})
```
